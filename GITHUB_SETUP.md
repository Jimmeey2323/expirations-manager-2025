# GitHub Repository Setup Complete ✅

Your Expirations Manager 2025 project has been successfully converted into a Git repository and pushed to GitHub!

## 📍 Repository URL
**https://github.com/Jimmeey2323/expirations-manager-2025.git**

## ✨ What Was Done

### 1. Security & Environment Variables
- ✅ Moved all sensitive credentials to environment variables
- ✅ Created `.env` file (local only, not committed)
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template for easy setup
- ✅ Updated `src/config/google.ts` to use `import.meta.env`
- ✅ Ensured `.env` is in `.gitignore`

### 2. Git Repository Setup
- ✅ Initialized Git repository
- ✅ Created clean commit history without secrets
- ✅ Added remote origin pointing to your GitHub repo
- ✅ Pushed to `main` branch successfully

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - Feature overview
  - Quick start guide
  - Google Sheets setup instructions
  - Project structure
  - Tech stack details
  - Scripts documentation

## 📋 Environment Variables

Your `.env` file contains (local only, NOT in repo):
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
VITE_GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_actual_refresh_token_here
VITE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_actual_spreadsheet_id_here
```

The `.env.example` file (in repo) provides a template for other developers.

**Note**: Your actual credentials are stored locally in your `.env` file and are NOT committed to Git.

## 🚀 Next Steps for Collaborators

2. **Install dependencies**

```

8d77b8a Security: Move sensitive credentials to environment variables
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Rotate credentials if needed** - Since the old credentials were in commit history, consider generating new OAuth tokens
3. **GitHub Secret Protection** - GitHub blocked the initial push because it detected secrets, which is a good security feature
4. **Environment Setup** - Anyone cloning the repo needs to create their own `.env` file
